# Code Search is All You Need? Improving Code Suggestions With Code Search


This is the implementation of our ICSE'24 paper "Code Search is All You Need? Improving Code Suggestions With Code Search".


Our datasets can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hIhnHuzpyrKnF4nusmJYYtNk9AQ6f_Hr/view?usp=sharing). Due to storage limitations, we provide our models only via [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1evYOESMCyZUozDm775ebuw?pwd=152u).
