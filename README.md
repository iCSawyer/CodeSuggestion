# Code Search is All You Need? Improving Code Suggestions with Code Search

This is the implementation of our ICSE'24 paper "Code Search is All You Need? Improving Code Suggestions with Code Search".


# Datasets
Our datasets can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bp-9eKby8pFdqSOxa5TpRppqkyy4VDUr/view?usp=sharing). Due to storage limitations, we provide our models only via [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1evYOESMCyZUozDm775ebuw?pwd=152u).

These datasets are processed on [CodeXGLUE](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE/tree/main/Code-Text/code-to-text), [CodeMatcher](https://bitbucket.org/ChaoLiuCQ/codematcher/src/master/), and [PyTorrent(Both_Docstrings_UserComments_v2)](https://zenodo.org/records/4546290) 


# Acknowledgment
